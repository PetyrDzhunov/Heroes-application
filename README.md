# Heroes-application
Hey everybody , this is a single page application in which I used sammy.js for routing and handlebars for templating.
I made this project with the idea to train myself into few paths :
1. Using JS libraries
2. Training my functional programming (trying to make pure functions as much as possible)
3. Training my github skills
4. Training my architecture skills and how a small SPA project should be (yet not using any bundler).

P.S.  - CSS & HTML are not the thing i am working at here. I am going to them with full attention after this :)
